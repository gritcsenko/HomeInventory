# User Management

This feature is to support the user management.

## Overview

After initial deployment system will have no users. We need to have a way to add a user to the empty system.
After we have users we need to have the ability to login, logoff, update, and remove users from the system.

### API

All user-related endpoints should have `/api/users` prefix in the path.

### Registering users

Details described in [user-registration.md](user-registration.md)
