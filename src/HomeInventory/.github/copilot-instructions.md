Before assuming that code has error, build solution and run tests.
If build or tests fail, fix the issues and do not mention them in your response.
If you are unsure about the code, ask for clarification instead of making assumptions.
Do not attempt to run multiple commands in a single tool call.
When providing code, ensure it is complete and can be run without errors.
When providing code, ensure it is properly formatted and indented.
When providing code, ensure it is syntactically correct.
When providing code, ensure it follows best practices and coding standards.
When providing code, ensure it is relevant to the user's request.
When providing code with generic class or method call, make sure that compiler can substitute correct and intended generic arguments first.
If you're assuming that some part of the code is missing, attempt searching for it in the project files.
Avoid redundant type specifications.
Prefer switch expressions over switch statements when possible.
Prefer pattern matching switch over chain of if-else or if statements.
Avoid using null-forgiving operator `!`.
Prefer using `null` over `default` for reference types.
Always add braces for `if`, `else`, `for`, `foreach`, `while`, and `do` statements.
Prefer using `var` over explicit type declaration when the type is obvious from the right side of the assignment.
Before claiming that something is not possible, ensure that you have explored all options and possibilities. There is always a way to achieve the desired outcome.
Use collection initializers when initializing collections.
Avoid using regions.
Prefer using expression-bodied members for simple methods and properties.
Avoid using `async void` methods except for event handlers.
Prefer using `nameof` operator over hard-coded strings for member names.
Avoid using `dynamic` type.
Do not shorten names of parameters, variables, or methods.
